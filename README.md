### A simple airplane that is easy to fold 

* Fold the paper in half lengthwise, and then unfold.
* Fold the top two corners down so they meet the center crease.
* Flip the plane over, and fold the corners in again to the center crease. You want the diagonal line coming off the top of the plane (on the left side) to be lined up with the middle (like on the right side).
* After both folds are complete, you want to fold the top point down so that the tip meets the bottom of where the previous folds come together.
* Fold the entire plane in half, in on itself. This creates the snub nose. 
* Fold the wings down so that youâ€™re making a straight line across from the top of the snub nose. Repeat on the other side.
* And your done! Now go have some fun!
